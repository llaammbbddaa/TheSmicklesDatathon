Create a regression tree model (decision tree / CART) to predict Mortality Rate (%) from globalHealthStats.csv. Use the columns provided (Country, Year, Disease Name, Disease Category, Prevalence Rate (%), Incidence Rate (%), Age Group, Gender, Population Affected, Healthcare Access (%), Doctors per 1000, Hospital Beds per 1000, Treatment Type, Average Treatment Cost (USD), Availability of Vaccines/Treatment, Recovery Rate (%), DALYs, Improvement in 5 Years (%), Per Capita Income (USD), Education Index, Urbanization Rate (%)). Include: 1) preprocessing (missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling if needed), 2) train/validation split with cross-validation, 3) hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, min_samples_leaf, criterion), 4) performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²), 5) feature importance and partial dependence plots for the top features, and 6) save the final model to disk (joblib/pickle). Use Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn). Output runnable code and short explanation of each step.

also plot and visualize the full decision tree as an image, only do this at the end
